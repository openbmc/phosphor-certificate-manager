When would we ever pass an empty string to this?\n\nEven if we needed to, would quoting it (ie --unit\u003d\"${UNIT}\" ) solve the issue?  I\u0027m still not sure why we need it though.",

      "message": "The problem comes from the \"pcm@nslcd\" service. I couldn\u0027t find the source of its env file. But in the QEMU, it\u0027s something like\n\n```\nENDPOINT\u003dnslcd\nCERTPATH\u003d/etc/ssl/certs/authority\nTYPE\u003dnslcd\n```\nwhich doesn\u0027t define \"UNIT\". It results in ExecStart is equal to \"/usr/bin/env phosphor-certificate-manager --endpoint\u003dxxx --path\u003dxxx --unit\u003d --type\u003dxxx\", and CLI11 complains about no TEXT for the unit option. \n\nI have tried various method\n\n1. --unit\u003d\"${UNIT}\"\n2. --unit\u003d\u0027${UNIT}\u0027\n3. escape quote\n4. escape single quote\n5. default variable: ${UNIT:\u003d\"\"} and its escaped version\n\nUnfortunately none of them worked. The reason might be cause by the weird systemd built-in string parse. \"if else\" with bash script is only one which worked. \n\nI also tried if there\u0027s a way to not requiring a value for an option in CLI11 but it seems impossible.\n\n\"/bin/sh\" should be available in most linux distro. Given that many other OpenBMC and Google BMC services also use it, it might not be a big deal.",
