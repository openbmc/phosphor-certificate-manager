      "message": "We should probably have that discussion with Brad (outside this review).  He\u0027s been telling people to move all service files into the repositories and outside of recipes.\n\nI don\u0027t know that there is a \"right\" or \"wrong\" way, specifically on the target symlinks, because on a normal linux distribution packages typically rely on the system admin to do the \"systemctl enable\".  For OpenBMC we don\u0027t have a system admin who can do the enable like that, so we need to do it as part of the install step.\n\nMy opinion is that leaving the enable to the distribution (openbmc/openbmc) is probably more appropriate and normal therefore, but you end up with this separation of concerns that I think Brad was trying to avoid (I\u0027m not sure I fully grasp his rationale).",
